** C++11 initializer lists
- welcome

** container initialization in C++98
- Can be overly verbose of you just want a container with a known content.
- If you want the container to be const, you need a separate function.

** std::initializer_list
- reference

** public interface
- private constructor accessible by the compiler

** named initializer lists
- let's assign initializer lists to variables
- not really nice, but shows how the mechanism works
- nested would be nice, but could be pair or list
- const type is important -> needs to match exactly
- assign=, () {}
- if used like this, it's not really satisfactory

** std::map initializer_list constructor
- shwos the type requirement we just found out
- the const in pair<const _Key is important

** containers 11
- put the initializer lists to work
- if the compiler can deduce the types, we can use the nice syntax
- The containers can be const now

** initialization list constructor
- you can use initialization list constructor in your own types
- overly simple example
- shows usage in a range for loop

** what the celebs say
- let the audience read
