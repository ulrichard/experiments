\begin{frame}{Warning when installing PointLine}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{obsolete_signature.png}
% some of you might have noticed for the first time that we sign our installers
% when this warning started appearing at the start of 2016 upon trying to 
% install PointLine
% Who in the audience saw this warning?
% Who knows why it appeared?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Table of contents}
\begin{itemize}
\item How code signing works
\item What the signature asserts
\item What attacks can the signature protect against
\item What attacks does code signing not protect against
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{PointLine signature}
\includegraphics[scale=0.38]{pointLine_signature.png}
% you can inspect the signature yourself by right-clicking a program file or dll
% The important part is : "This digital signature is OK."
% Who in the audience actually checked a signature before installing a software?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How code signing works}
\emph{Pre-conditions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a large random private key
\item The public key is derived from it
\item Buy a certificate for your public key
\end{itemize}
\pause
\\[0.2cm]
\emph{Signing the software}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a digest (hash) of the binary
\item Sign it with the private key
\item Signature, public key and certificate are attached to the binary
\end{itemize}
\pause
\\[0.2cm]
\emph{Verifying the signature}
\begin{itemize}
\item Everybody with the public key can verify the signature
\item Certificate creates trust link to known root
\item Roots are shipped with the operating system
\end{itemize}
% most of this also applies to tls certificates for secure web browsing
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What the signature asserts}
\begin{itemize}
\item Publisher assures that the software is genuine
\item Certificate confirms that the publisher is who he says he is
\item The file did not change since it was signed
\item It was signed on the indicated day (timestamp)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How do we know the signature is from whom it says}
\begin{itemize}
\item Borm bought a certificate from a certificate authority
\item The certificate authority checked a trade register document
\item The certificate authority bought a certificate from a root authority
\item Root certificates are shipped with the operating system
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Certificate authority hierarchies}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What attacks does the signature protect against}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tampering with the licensing mechanism and selling as original
\item Tampering with the software to make it buggy for discrediting
\item Bundling malware by copycat publisher (angry bird clones)
\item Bundling malware by proxy or man in the middle
\begin{itemize}
\item Internet Service Provider
\item Public, hotel or corporate WiFi
\item TOR exit nodes
\item Great firewall of china
\end{itemize}
\item Bundling malware by download site
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Definition of malware}
\emph{Malware}, short for malicious software, is any software used to disrupt computer operations, gather sensitive information, gain access to private computer systems, or display unwanted advertising.
\\[0.2cm]
\emph{Malware} is defined by its malicious intent, acting against the requirements of the computer user, and does not include software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency.
\\[0.2cm]
source: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware}
% the border between malware and crapware is not always clear
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{definition of backdoor}
A \emph{backdoor} is a method, often secret, of bypassing normal authentication in a product, computer system, cryptosystem or algorithm etc.
\\[0.2cm]
\emph{Backdoors} are often used for securing unauthorized remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptographic systems.

\begin{frame}{Involuntarily vulnerable}
\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fortinet.png}
% It doesn't have to be the operator of the network himself
% A firewall with a known backdoor is an invitation for crooks
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{SourceForge bundling malware}
\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{sourceforge.png}
% Was once the most popular and trusted site to host opensource projects
% Is adware less problematic?
% The screenshot indicates that there is a valid signature, but not from the publisher
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What attacks does code signing not protect against}
\begin{itemize}
\item Weak hash or crypto used for the signature
\item Hacker sneaking backdoor into source code
\item Coerced employee sneaking backdoor into source code
\item Publisher intentionally adding backdoor
\item Compromised build environment (computer)
\item Compromised build tools (compiler)
\item Bundling malware by publisher
\item Insecure coding practices
\item Bribed timestamping provider
\item Compromised certificate authority
\item Private key stolen or unintentionally published
\end{itemize}
\\[0.2cm]
% Let's make a distinction here
% Hackers select their targets by evaluating return on investment
Which of these are targeted vs. automated attacks
% how could we fix these problems?
% let's look at them one at a time.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weak hash or crypto used for the signature}
\includegraphics[scale=0.27]{sha1.png}
% The article is from last october
% This is what triggered the warning on the first slide
% It was relatively easy to fix
% We bought a new certificate and adapted the build process
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Backdoors in the source code}
\emph{Developers can mitigate the risk using:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Good version control system
\item Code reviews
\item Having control over artefacts % tampering with 3rd party libs might be harder to detect
\end{itemize}
\\[0.2cm]
\pause
\emph{But how can the user be confident enough?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reputation                    % not enough, but ofthen that's all you get
\item Promises                      % really? Coerced publisher will deny
\item Independent code reviews      % doesn't fit well with agile development
\item OpenSource                    % convincing - the only way you can really trust your software
\end{itemize}
% Beleve is for the church. Being able to verify something enables trust.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Publisher intentionally adding backdoor}
\includegraphics[scale=0.27]{skype.png}
% no big surprise from that company

\begin{frame}{Resulting difference in the binary}
What is the difference between \textcolor{red}{if (a \textgreater b)} and \textcolor{mygreen}{if (a \textgreater= b)} in x86 assembly? 
\begin{flushleft}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Compromised build environment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Unlikely but very serious\\
\item An attack would have to be targeted\\ % and we're an unlikely target
\item The build host is the one component you still have to trust even with traditional open source distributions. % so far
\end{itemize}
\\[0.2cm]
\pause
\emph{Problems:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hard to detect
\item Once infected, almost impossible to clean
\item Can result from any backdoored software with enough access
\end{itemize}
\\[0.2cm]
\pause
\emph{What can we do to prevent?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tight access control and monitoring
\item Redundant build environments  % usually not binary equal. Even timestamps can make the difference
\item Debian reproducible builds    % closing the last loophole
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation for reproducible builds}
With free software, anyone can inspect the source code for malicious flaws. But Debian provide binary packages to its users. The idea of “deterministic” or “reproducible” builds is to empower anyone to verify that no flaws have been introduced during the build process by reproducing byte-for-byte identical binary packages from a given source. \\
source: \href{https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/About}{https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/About}
\\[0.1cm]
We often speak as if open source software can't contain backdoors or malware because its source code is "published", rendering any potentially malicious code visible. But real-world software release processes have major transparency gaps that aren't addressed by most existing open source development practices. The biggest such gap is that compilation and packaging processes aren't reproducible. Trying to recreate these processes typically yields a different result. That means users can't directly verify that the binary releases they download and use were actually created from the purportedly corresponding source trees.\\

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Debian build procedure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Upstream author releases a source tarball with signature
\pause
\item Debian developer creates a source package which:
\begin{itemize}
\item Specifies where the original sources and signature can be downloaded
\item Specifies how the package is built
\item Might add some debian specific patches
\item Includes the public key of the upstream author in the package
\item Signs the source package and uploads it to the repository
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item Build servers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Download the source package and the original tarbal
\item Verify both signatures
\item Apply the patches
\item Build as instructed
\item Create a binary package
\item Sign the binary package and uploads it to the repository
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item Binary packages from multiple build servers are compared
\item Currently 87.6\% of debian packages build reproducibly for amd64
\end{itemize}
% Imagine how much harder it would be for VW to roll out cheating emission controls with a process like this
% For the current stable release there were other priorities, but it will be one of the big points for the next one.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Package overview}
\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{debian_qa.png}
% cardpeek has a reproducibility problem
% some packages don't build on esotheric or experimental platforms such as ppc, hurd or kfreebsd
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Compromised build tools}
\emph{Unlikely but very serious}
\\[0.2cm]
\begin{itemize}
\item Not much you can do
\item Trust whomever sold it to you
\item Use a well reviewed open source tool chain
\end{itemize}
% hard to defend against
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{This is not just theory}
\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{apple_toolchain.png}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bundling malware by publisher}
\emph{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Oracle Java
\item Compression tool served by Npackd % a package manager for windows
\item Email offers if you ever published an Android app
\end{itemize}
\\[0.2cm]
\pause
\emph{As a software publisher:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Just don't do it!
\item Loosing users and trust is not worth the few bucks
\end{itemize}
\\[0.2cm]
\pause
\emph{As the user:}
\begin{itemize}
\item I try not to use software, if I have reason to beleve it is compromised % even if it is forced on us
\begin{itemize}
\item Or if the company uses other abusive practices such as
\begin{itemize}
\item Bribing or deception
\item Vendor-lock-in
\item Digital Rights Management
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item There are always plenty of good alternatives
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bundling malware by publisher}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{oracle.png}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Insecure coding practices}
\emph{As a software publisher:}
\begin{itemize}
\item I won't go into details here
\item Events just like today address this very issue
\end{itemize}
\\[0.2cm]
\pause
\emph{As the user:}
\begin{itemize}
\item With closed source software, you can only guess
\item A shiny GUI tells nothing about what's behind
\item If it crashes a lot, there might be more at odds
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bribed timestamping provider}
This is probably the least severe case here
\\[0.2cm]
Timestamp provider is a single point of failure.
\\[0.2cm]
More secure methods, you can prove something existed at a certain date.
\\[0.2cm]
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a hash of a document and publish it in a newspaper
\pause
\item There is a service called \emph{proof of existence} that stores the hash on the BitCoin blockchain
\end{itemize}
% Nobody would even care if PointLine had a wrong timestamp in the signature.
% The warning on the first slide could be avoided with a 2015 timestamp.
% But it's much easier to buy a new certificate.
% BitCoin's BlockChain is a tamper resistant distributed consensus system
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Compromised certificate authority}
\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{diginotar.png}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Compromised certificate authority}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{certificate_authority_compromised.png}
% First the compromise has to be noticed
% Revoking the key invalidates also lots of legitimate certificates
% Timestamps could play a more important role here
% Why do we have such a hierarchical structure in the first place?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Trust models}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{trust_models.jpeg}
% hierarchies introduce single points of failure
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Web of trust}
\includegraphics[scale=0.44]{web_of_trust.png}
% Harder to maintain
% More resilient
% Trust is not just boolean, but can be calculated
% Bank with brass plate with QR code of public key
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{NameCoin}
\emph{Namecoin} is a decentralized open source information registration and transfer system based on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency
\begin{itemize}
\item Domain names for .bit TLD
\begin{itemize}
\item Including TLS fingerprint
\end{itemize}
\item Identity information 
\end{itemize}
\\[0.2cm]
\pause
\emph{Zooko's triangle}: properties considered desirable for names of participants in a network protocol
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Human-meaningful}: Meaningfulness and memorability to the users
\item \emph{Decentralized}: No need of a centralized authority for determining the meaning of a name
\item \emph{Secure}: There is one, unique and specific entity to which the name applies
\end{itemize}
\\[0.2cm]
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{zooko_triangle.png}
% essentially a secure key value store
% name and TLS certificate are tied together
% simple script for dyndns
% after seeing this it seems strange that you have to buy the name and certificate from different entities with the legacy system
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Private key stolen or unintentionally published}
A private key is a very sensitive piece of information, and should be treated accodingly.
\\[0.2cm]
\begin{itemize}
\item A surprising number of private keys were found in github repositories
\item Never send a private key over unencrypted eMail % Reto has a story to this
\item Never store a private key unencrypted on a cloud starage
\item If possible store private keys only on airgapped machines and hardware devices
\item A good example is the YubiKey NEO with an OpenPGP applet
\item If you have to store it on disk, restric the access rights
\end{itemize}
